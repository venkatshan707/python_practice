    "In the provided code, the add function is indirectly called when you invoke add_logger or sub_logger, even though you don't explicitly call add or sub. This is due to the mechanism of closures and how they retain access to the original function (add or sub). Let's break down how add gets called indirectly:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Closure Creation:**\n",
    "When you create add_logger or sub_logger by passing add or sub to the logger function, you're essentially creating a closure. This closure retains access to the original function (add or sub) as a result of being defined within the scope of the logger function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logging Functionality:**\n",
    "Inside the logger function, there's an inner function named log_func. This function is what actually gets called when you invoke add_logger or sub_logger.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Calling the Original Function:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Within log_func, after logging information about the function call in example.log file, the original function (add or sub) is called. This happens implicitly through the use of func(*args) inside log_func. Here, func refers to the original function (add or sub) that was passed to logger, and args contains the arguments passed to add_logger or sub_logger.**\n",
    "\n",
    "So, add() function passed as argument (func) to the  outer function. when we call **print(func(*args))**, this calls add(3,3) on the first function call.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Access to Original Function:**\n",
    "Crucially, log_func retains access to the original add or sub function due to the closure created when you called logger. Even though you're not directly calling add or sub, log_func can still access and execute them because it captures and retains a reference to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, when you invoke add_logger(3, 3) or sub_logger(10, 5), the log_func within the respective closure (add_logger or sub_logger) is executed. Inside log_func, the original function (add or sub) is called with the provided arguments. This indirect invocation of add or sub is facilitated by the closure mechanism, allowing for logging and execution of the original functions seamlessly within the closure."

    "**When and Why to Use Closures**\n",
    "1. As Python closures are used as callback functions, they provide some sort of data hiding. This helps us to reduce the use of global variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When we have few functions in our code, closures in Python prove to be an efficient way. But if we need to have many functions, then go for class (OOP).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. We may have variables in the global scope that are not used by many functions at times. Instead of defining variables in global scope, consider using a closure. They can be defined in the outer function and used in the inner function. Python Closures are also useful for avoiding the use of a global scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. A class in the Python programming language always has the __init__ method. If you only have one extra method, an elegant solution would be to use a closure rather than a class. Because this improves code readability and even reduces the programmer’s workload. Closures in Python can thus be used to avoid the needless use of a class."

    "## Explain the difference between nested function, wrapper, closure and decortors\n",
    "\n",
    "Nested Function, Wrapper, Closure, and Decorators are all related concepts in programming, especially in languages that support higher-order functions and functional programming paradigms like Python. However, they serve different purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nested Function:**\n",
    "* A nested function is a function defined within another function.\n",
    "* The inner function is scoped within the outer function and has access to the variables of the outer function's scope.\n",
    "* Nested functions are used for organizing code, reducing namespace pollution, and encapsulating functionality within a specific scope.\n",
    "* They are not necessarily wrappers; they might perform specific tasks within the outer function without necessarily wrapping another function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Wrapper Function:**\n",
    "* A wrapper function is a function that encapsulates or \"wraps\" another function or piece of functionality.\n",
    "* It typically provides additional functionality before or after calling the inner function, modifies input or output, or provides a different interface to the inner function.\n",
    "* Wrapper functions can contain nested functions, but not all nested functions are wrapper functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Closure:**\n",
    "* A closure is a function that captures and remembers the environment in which it was created.\n",
    "* It has access to variables from its lexical scope even after the scope has finished executing.\n",
    "* Closures are often used to create functions with persistent local state or to create functions that \"remember\" values from their enclosing scope.\n",
    "* Closures are not necessarily nested functions or wrapper functions, but they can be implemented using nested functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decorator:**\n",
    "* A decorator is a function that takes another function as input and returns a new function that usually extends or modifies the behavior of the original function.\n",
    "* Decorators are typically used to add functionality to functions without modifying their code directly.\n",
    "* They are often implemented using closures and/or wrapper functions.\n",
    "Decorators are a higher-level concept that can encompass the functionality of nested functions, wrapper functions, and closures.\n",
    "I\n",
    "n summary, while nested functions, wrapper functions, closures, and decorators are related concepts, they serve different purposes and can be used independently or in conjunction with each other depending on the requirements of the programming task."
